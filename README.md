# Zero-Width-Steganography
A simple gui program that uses steganographic encryption to hide secret messages inside of text.
This method will hide text in plain sight using invisible zero-width characters, although some text editors may make it obvious that invisible characters are present in the string.
This tool was inspired by [Steganographr](https://github.com/neatnik/steganographr)

## Characters
This tool uses:
- WORD JOINER (U+2060)
- ZERO WIDTH SPACE (U+200B)
- ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (U+200C)
